                    You're the one who taught me how to properly use angles, which songs to use, <br>
                    which filters or templates to apply, and how to act when our picture is getting taken. <br>
                    I learned so much because of you, and now, I upload multiple stories or even posts of us <br>
                    just to show everyone who my lovely girlfriend is. <br>

                        August! This is the month where you're campaining for the upcoming Student Council Election. <br>
                        I remember the times where you often cling to me because of how tired you were from the campaign. <br>
                        Every time I see you, I feel a sense of pitiness, because I don't like it when I see you that <br>
                        exhausted. Still, I continued being the supportive boyfriend for you, and I'm super proud of you that <br>
                        even if you don't have any competition, you still put in the effort to convice the school to vote for you. <br>
                        I admire your diligence and your perseverance, because no matter how hard and exhausting the campaign may be <br>
                        you're still putting in effort, and to make sure that your last performance is the same as your first. <br>

                        Here we go, September! This is the month where you were most busy. You just have so much things to do. <br>
                        From VYD to the Intramurals, those events are something that you have to think about. I can still <br>
                        remember that practices that you attended just to hone your voice for the upcoming Harana, and I'm soo <br>
                        proud of you for doing so well in your performance. I may not be there physically, but I tuned in <br>
                        the live, making sure that I can hear your performance in real time. I love the fact that <br>
                        even though you have countless reasons to turn from your responsibilities, you still didn't do it. <br>
                        I'm also proud of you for doing the schedules for the Intramurals. Even though you have a lot in <br>
                        your mind, and even though you cried yourself to sleep on my shoulder back then, you still <br>
                        persevered to finish the schedule. I love you soo much!

                        We've reached october! This month has been the happiest and the saddest month. <br>
                        This is the month where I experienced many of my first times. You are my first kiss, the first person I went on a date with, and the first person I went on a field trip with. <br>
                        I'm happy for all the memories that we've made together, my love. I'm happy that in every single happy moment, you are always here with me. <br>
                        This is also the month where we almost ended our relationship multiple times, but I'm super grateful that we didn't. I'm happy with you, and I love you so much <br>
                        I don't want to lose you, and I'm super thankful that even through all that problems, you still kept choosing me and you still fought for our relationship. <br>
                        I love you, my love.
